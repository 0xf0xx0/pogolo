solo db-less ui-less bitcoin-only mining pool  
not meant to be exposed to the internet  
infinite thanks to btcd for bitcoin tooling and public-pool

# setup
```
username: <your address>[.<worker name>]
password: <ignored>
```

TODO
- client difficulty adjustment
- share replay mitigation
- stratum keepalive?
- public-pool compatible api?
- client.reconnect on server restart?
